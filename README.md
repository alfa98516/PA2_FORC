# Data Structures

### What abstract data structures we implemented

1. Dynamically sized array:
    * Implemented a vector with an array
2. Linked list data structure:
    * Implemented a Doubly linked list.
3. Queue, stack, OR double-ended queue data structure:
    * Implemented a deque with circular array.
4. Heap data structure:
    * Implemented a heap with an array.
5. Hash table structure:
    * Implemented a separate chaining hash map with linked lists and our dynamic vector
6. Self-balancing binary search tree structure:
    * Implemented a self-balancing binary tree using left-leaning-red-black tree.

### What needs to be written in the terminal to compile and run the data structures

DataStructure:

* Array: array
* Dll: dll
* Dequeue: dequeue
* Heap: heap2
* Hashmap: hashmap
* Binary tree: bst

To compile:

```bash
make <DataStructure>
```

To test the data structure:

```bash
./<DataStructure>
```

To delete/clean the binary files, run:

```bash
make clean
```
